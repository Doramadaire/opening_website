This work came into being in an alternative to the 'classic' shot where posing time is relatively short. In 2012, after 3 years of fighting illness, the questions of temporality and movement appeared to me as a departure point for technical and visual art research. Via this technique which goes back to the beginning of the history of photography, I achieved a research body of work with a technique somewhere between mastery and sensitive intuition. I place a 24 X 36 apparatus transformed into a pinhole in the car, framed blind and shot at a strong emotional moment. Subsequently I let the movement of the working car bring to light and show the un thought of aspects of the emotion felt.” Valérie Horwitz
