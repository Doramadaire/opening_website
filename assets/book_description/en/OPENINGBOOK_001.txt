Opening book presents twelve works from the Habere series, an ensemble of one hundred pieces of paper cut in a unique format of 41 x 40 cm each one representing a shell. Campanile symbolicum, Scalaire précieuse, Neptune semester :   each shell is drawn to a scale of 1 then meticulously engraved on the papers surface with slow precise scalpel incisions. A fragile edifice of void and paper, each one appearing both as a patiently indexed live figure and as a metaphor of the artist as the sculptor of his own internal space.
