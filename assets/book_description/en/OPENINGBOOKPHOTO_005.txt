Children's gestures, light effects, living or inanimate things seized in the beauty of  an instant... minuscule details that Emmanuelle Sarrouy records daily, fragmenting reality in a multitude of  tightly framed and softly toned images. The use of a smartphone and it's automatic filters confers onto them a retro effect, an assumed nostalgic weight. She composes these images, these triptychs, short sequences condensing reality, visual haikus, like so many entries into a personal photographic diary. Opening book 005 presents twelve of these triptychs which are a part of, along with other elements (videos, texts), of a multimedia project entitled PERSIKOV (… the path of flowers) a work in progress. “Memories are gone but the images are here and they're real !” Jonas Mekas
