The work of Anne-Valerie Gasc weaves a contradictory link between the conditions of the apparition of a work of art and those of the disparition, the explosive demolition of architecture. 
<br>
<br>For Opening, Anne-Valerie Gasc created a series of tracings and models made in 2010 following her visit to the EPC factory (Exposives and Chemical Products) at the La Dynamite* site in Saint-Martin-de-Crau (Camargue). These hitherto unseen documents, gather together the micro-architectures and objects neccessary for the fabrication, experimentation, transport and storage of explosives. They constitute, in the eyes of the artist, a vocabulary of constructed spaces and objects linked to the perspective of their own  demolition : the architypes of a possible anti-architecture.
