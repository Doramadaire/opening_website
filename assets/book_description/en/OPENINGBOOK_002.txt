Opening book 002 performs a sort of traveling through twelve works on canvas and paper which tackle the recurring themes in the works of Isabelle Schneider :  body, war and landscape. Twelve recent paintings - details of female bodies and views of military cemeteries - appearing and disappearing over the course of the pages upon which a water colored landscape unfolds, thereby manifesting the formula of Christian Noorbergen : " Landscape is sometimes a metaphor of skin, a metaphor of the exterior of a body, a terribly distant exterior. Like a smoke screen, the landscape is only there as a body support, and the painting becomes the skin of an immense finally habitable body."
