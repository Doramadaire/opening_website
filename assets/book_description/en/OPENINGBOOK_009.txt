Opening book presents twenty felt-tip and ink on paper drawings which compose a single indivisible polyptych of 1,60 x 1,50m, in which the eye is invited to meander at its own convenience over the pages and cut-outs. Françoise Donadieu, who has maintained a long complicity with the work of Françoise Semiramoth wrote about her in the text Jungle Paradise, reproduced in regards to polyptyic.
