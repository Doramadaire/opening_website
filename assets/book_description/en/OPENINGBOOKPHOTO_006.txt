Twelve pictures, specially put together for Opening book, from photographs taken from the series Dogwalk. 
<br>“Brigitte Bauer walks her dog every day along the Rhône in the vicinity of Arles.
<br>She always takes her mobile phone with which she photographs her dog as it explores the territory.
<br>Dogs suggest a different way of navigating in the world, a different way of seeing, and they take humans back to a more ancient time, a time before nations and formal borders, to an imaginary utopic life from which fear is absent. It is perhaps, incidentally, for this reason that we have dogs : they remind us that it is possible to emancipate ourselves from the constraints of borders, and to consider the world as an ensemble of liquid territories.” (Paul Wombell)
