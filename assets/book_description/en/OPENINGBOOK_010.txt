Opening book 010 establishes a visual dialogue between different techniques and formats (oil, acrylic, watercolour; on canvas and on paper) ; but all nevertheless irrigated by the same imagination, the same colour sensuality. The entirety brings into evidence the underlying tensions of Armelle dSM between form and formless, mineral and organic, all steeped in ambiguity.
