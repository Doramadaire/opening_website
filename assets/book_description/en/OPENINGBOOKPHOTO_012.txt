Photography and sculpture are two mediums that cross over and intertwine in the work of Estelle Jourdain. The metallised common thread of light is present on her images as it is in her sculptures but on a lesser scale. The thread and it's corollary needle literally pierce the image, giving it a real or feigned density, according to whether the image is exhibited as is, or re-photographed. The above and below, the near and far, find themselves seized and drawn closer in the photographic flatness, by the effect of a rip or a stitch. In other images, it is transparency that plays a similar role : she installs, in a milky light bathed interval, objects grasped with a more or less emphatic contact. “This interim space is one where contraries can meet, complementaries also : a void, a silence where everything is possible.”(E.J.)
