Opening book 004 presents three recent series of works in small and medium format on wood and paper. Whether it concerns oil or pastel, the accent is put on the small variations of colour and the minor accidents of the matter itself. Following the example of the works themselves, the page layout is deliberately sober, the use of a zoom permits a virtual closeup of the surfaces, and thereby allows the perception of the optical, quasi musical vibrations, present beneath the chromatic variations.
