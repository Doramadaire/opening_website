“After a diploma in engraving and sounds, I explored diverse mediums, drawing, painting, metalwork, sculpture,  tissue paper installations. My work has been very inspired by an asiatic universe and philosophy. (…) The classical painting references of form, of theme (still life, light and dark) Eros frequently appears and sometimes citations from the Pop years in the treatment of colour. Images are always treated in series.” F Buadas.
