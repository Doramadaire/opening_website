Taken from several photographic series created since 1992, the assembled images in this new Opening book proposes a transversal interpretation of Emmanuelle Germain's work and reveals it's singularity.
<br>Whether they are plunged in a dream state or absorbed by movement or contemplation, the women photographed by Emmanuelle Germain are both absent and present at the same time. They establish a sensation of wavering between consciousness and unconsciousness, habited and inhabited. External and internal landscapes mix, whilst the fontier between the watcher and the watched continually moves.
