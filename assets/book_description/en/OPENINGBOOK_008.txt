Sous texte ("Under text") is a serie of letters written either in indian ink or acrylic paint on canvasthat is laid on top of paper. Passing through the canvas, the matter is more or less deposed on the paper, making the text disappear. Thereby leaving only the trace, the intention, the graphic vibration of thought.
